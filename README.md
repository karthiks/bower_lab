=========

A project to get my hands dirty with bower, a package manager utility by Twitter.

## A Quick Sumary
* Bower is a front-end package management utility tool.
* It is like [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) in the RoR world.
* Bower runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. A packaged component can be made up of any type of asset, and use any type of transport (e.g., AMD, CommonJS, etc.).
* Newer versions of Bower use bower.json to store package dependency information. The older versions of Bower were using components.json.
* To create a new file in the project repository, just ``` bower init ```
* To install a package, simply type ```bower install package_name#version``` as in
``` bower install jquery``` and ```bower install jquery#1.2.3```
